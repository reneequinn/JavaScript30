# Array Cardio Day 1

This challenge uses the browser console to work with arrays and built in methods filter, map, sort and reduce.

## What I learned

* ``Array.prototype.filter()`` to create a new array with all elements that meet the condition
* ``Array.protoype.map()`` to return an array of modified elements. e.g. the first and last names from an array of objects
* ``Array.prototype.sort()`` to sort the array in place comparing and return the sorted array
* ``Array.prototype.reduce()`` to execute a reducer function on each member of the array. This was used to calculate the total years lived in the inventors array, returning a single value. It was also used to count the instances of each mode of transport in the data array and return the items and values in an object
* Using ``console.table()`` to display values in a neater way than ``console.log()``
* Using ES6 features and arrow functions for more concise code
* Using the ternary operator to simplify if/else statements

### Additional notes

* I have not worked with arrays much, so found this to be a real challenge. I was able to complete the first two tasks on my own. Then I followed along with the tutorial.
* Where there are longer solutions to the challenges, I have kept them in the file as comments for future reference on how to make my code more concise.
