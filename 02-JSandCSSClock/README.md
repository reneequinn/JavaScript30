# JS and CSS Clock

This challenge uses the JS Date function with CSS to create an analog clock.

## What I learned

* Using the ``Date()`` function to get the current time in seconds, minutes and hours.
  * Using these values and translating them into degree.
* Using CSS ``transition`` and ``transform`` properties to animate and position the clock hands.
* Using an ``if/else`` statement to reset the  ``transition`` property to 0 when the seconds hand reaches 60, eliminating the glitch demonstrated in the tutorial.

### Additional notes

* Changed the colour of the seconds hand.
* Fiddled with the ``width`` and ``right`` properties of the hour hand to make it shorter.
