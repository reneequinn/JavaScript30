# Array Cardio Day 2

This challenge uses the browser console to explore the array methods some, every, find and findIndex

## What I learned

* ``.some()`` - check whether at least one item in an array meets a condition
* ``.every()`` - check if all items in an array meet a condition
* ``.find()`` - finds an item in array that matches a condition
* ``.findIndex()`` - returns the index of an item in an array that meets a condition
  * This was used with the ``.splice()`` method to remove the item from the array
  * The ``.slice()`` method was also used with the ``...`` spread operator to create a new array with the item removed

### Additional notes

* I feel as though the first array cardio challenge prepared me well for this one. I was able to work out how to work with the methods and convert to ES6 syntax more independently this time around.
