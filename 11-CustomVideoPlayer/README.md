# Custom Video Player

Using CSS and JavaScript, create custom controls for the HTML5 ``<video>`` element.

## What I learned

* Built-in methods, such as ``pause``, ``play`` and ``currentTime`` for the video element as an object
* Using ``this`` to handle range updates for both the volume and playback controls, instead of using two separate functions
* Using ``fullscreenElement``, ``requestFullscreen`` and ``exitFullscreen`` to create a custom fullscreen button

## Additional notes

* I was able to complete the additional challenge using [this MDN documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/requestFullScreen)
