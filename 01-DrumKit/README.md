# 1 - JavaScript Drum Kit

This challenge creates a virtual drum set that is controlled using the keyboard.

## What I learned

* About the HTML data-* attribute for identifying the key pressed on the keyboard.
  * This was used with the .key class to identify which div to apply the .playing class to.
  * This was also used with the audio tag to identify what sound to play.
* Practical application of CSS transition and transform properties. This is not something that I have used much previously.
  * Using an event listener to track the end of the transition and reset the appearance.
* Using functions with the audio tag to play sound and continue to play/override the sound playing with additional key presses.

### Additional notes

* After completing the challenge, I sourced a different background image. Photo by [JTMultimidia](https://www.pexels.com/@jtmultimidia-164235) from [Pexels](http://www.pexels.com)

* Changed the border colour of the boxes to white to contrast with the new background.
