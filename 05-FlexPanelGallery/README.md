# Flex Panel Gallery

This challenge uses JS and CSS flexbox to create a gallery of images that change in size and add or take away text when clicked

## What I learned

* Flex containers, flex items and how they behave
* Hiding and unhiding items using the ``transform`` property ``translateY`` to move on the vertical axis
* Toggling classes using function and event listeners ``click`` and ``transitionend``

### Additional notes

* This was a nice, quick challenge to do after array cardio. It's a great way to see how flexbox works in action.
