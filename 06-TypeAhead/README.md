# Type Ahead

This challenge takes input and matches cities or states based on what has been typed, from a JSON file using the built-in browser method ``fetch``

## What I learned

* Using the Fetch API to retrieve resources
* Working with JSON objects and promises
* Using RegExp to match input to any possible result, not just exact matches
* Creating an array of potential matches with the search term highlighted in each result using HTML formatting and a CSS class
* Converting the array back into a string for output to HTML

### Additional notes

* This was a really interesting project and I already want to make another with a different JSON file
